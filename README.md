# Ipsum Coffee

A small side project, built on the Audacious Aardvark Coding live stream, that generates coffee-themed lorem ipsum and features an API. Over-engineered with love to try out new Rails and Ruby features.

## Development

Check out the `.tool-versions` file for required versions of Ruby and install it on your system.

Once installed, run `bundle install` to pull in Ruby dependencies. Tests can be run with `bundle exec rails test` and the local server can be started with `bundle exec rails serve`.

## Contributing

Feel free to add GH issues and potentially we can talk about them on the live stream or I'll implement them in my spare time!

## Sponsoring

If you enjoy coffee-flavored Ipsum, or enjoy coding along with me, there are two sponsorship options.
